The Inference Gateway is a proxy server designed to facilitate access to various language model APIs. It allows users to interact with different language models through a unified interface, simplifying the configuration and the process of sending requests and receiving responses from multiple LLMs, enabling an easy use of Mixture of Experts.

- 🏠 **Self-Hosted**: Can be self-hosted for complete control over the deployment environment.

## Overview

You can horizontally scale the Inference Gateway to handle multiple requests from clients. The Inference Gateway will forward the requests to the respective provider and return the response to the client. The following diagram illustrates the flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] --> |POST /llms/provider/generate| Auth[Inference Gateway]
    A[Client] --> |POST /llms/provider/generate| Auth[Inference Gateway]
    A[Client] --> |POST /llms/provider/generate| Auth[Inference Gateway]
    Auth[Optional OIDC] --> |Auth?| IG1[Inference Gateway]
    Auth[Optional OIDC] --> |Auth?| IG2[Inference Gateway]
    Auth[Optional OIDC] --> |Auth?| IG3[Inference Gateway]
    IG1 --> P[Proxy Gateway]
    IG2 --> P[Proxy Gateway]
    IG3 --> P[Proxy Gateway]
    P[Proxy Gateway] --> C[Ollama]
    P[Proxy Gateway] --> D[Groq]
    P[Proxy Gateway] --> E[OpenAI]
    P[Proxy Gateway] --> F[Google]
    P[Proxy Gateway] --> G[Cloudflare]
    P[Proxy Gateway] --> H[Cohere]
    P[Proxy Gateway] --> H[Anthropic]
```

Client is sending:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/llms/openai/generate
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a pirate."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello, world! How are you doing today?"
      }
    ],
  }'
```

Client receives:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "response": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "content": "Ahoy, matey! 🏴‍☠️ The seas be wild, the sun be bright, and this here pirate be ready to conquer the day! What be yer business, landlubber? 🦜"
  }
}
```

## Motivation

My motivation is to build AI Agents without being tied to a single vendor. By avoiding vendor lock-in and supporting self-hosted LLMs from a single interface, organizations gain both portability and data privacy. You can choose to consume LLMs from a cloud provider or run them entirely offline with Ollama.
