These are deprecated in favor of a single handler v1/models

* refactor: Remove OpenAICompatible from the code names, keep it agnostic, just leave a docblock to inform it's compatible is enough

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* build: Update versions in Dockerfile and CI workflow for dependencies

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* refactor(routes): Enhance provider determination logic in ChatCompletionsHandler

Allow users to specify the prefix of the provider in the model name, simplifies configurations of Coding editors and extensions

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* docs(openapi): Add CreateCompletion endpoint and request/response schemas

Seems like the older version of this API, but some coding tools still using it, so adding the minimal of it for backward compatibility.

I assume it's like in Ollama API where you send tokens and you receive some tokens back - only the completion rather than the entire chat. Perhaps it's there for a reason because it's more efficient, less tokens needs to be passed over the connection wire. Curious to see how the IDE's is using it.

* feat(api): Add CompletionsHandler endpoint for creating completions

TODO - I need to implement this so the IDE's like cursor and IDE's extensions like continue.dev will work.

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* chore: Run task generate

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* refactor(api): Remove unused CompletionsHandler and related OpenAPI definitions

This is a legacy endpoint and could be opt-out in different existing tools, so no need to implement it, probably for now.

* chore: Uncomment command to generate ProvidersCommonTypes in Taskfile

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* chore(codegen): Enhance code generation with new types and improved formatting logic

It works well, just need to make it work well with enums instead of hard-coding them, but for now will just hardcode them.

* refactor(api): Mark ResponseTokens and GenerateResponse as deprecated

Will remove them at the end on the cleanup stage, still need to refactor GenerateResponseTokens function.

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* refactor(api): Update endpoint structure to use 'Models' and 'Chat' instead of 'List' and 'Generate'

Also remove dead code, functions for generating providers that I wanted to use but I never completed, I'll probably get back to it once there is a clear process.
Many providers now don't even need specific mutations since they became compatible with OpenAI.

* refactor(api): Mark GenerateRequest as deprecated in OpenAPI definition

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* refactor(api): Update provider API URLs to include versioning and enhance endpoint structure

Re-implement chat completion endpoint for all providers, it's now fully OpenAI compatible.

Some providers like cohere and cloudflare didn't make the /v1/models end point compatible, only the /v1/chat/completions endpoint, which is kind of weird, so I had to create an extra compatibility also for the list endpoint.

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* chore(api): Clean up too many comments, leave only the essentials, the code is self explanatory

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* refactor(api): Simplify streaming API

Removed some unnecessary logic, since most providers have now OpenAI compatibility API that means no extra logic needs to be implemented, sending the response back to the client as-is, which results in better performance.

Still need to test Ollama, when the server is timing out the streaming is being closed unexpectedly, I didn't figure out how to increase the timeout on Ollama server, since it's running locally it takes longer to generate the tokens. I did find out in their documentation how to enable Debugging messages, and it's a bit clearer that my request was failing due to timeout on Ollama server. It's nowhere documented so I'll have to figure out.

Other providers works almost seamlessly. Need to write new tests with this OpenAI compatible API.

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* chore(wip): Need to test the monitoring

Will probably continue tomorrow, seems like most providers provide token counts but not the total time etc, it's not in OpenAI specifications - only Groq provide it, I'll comment it out for now.

I had to parse the stream in order to get the usage in the final message properly.

TODO - I need to figure out why Ollama OpenAI compatible API is not sending the usage on the final message.

* refactor(api): Update README examples and OpenAPI schema to reflect changes in chat completions and tool call structure

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* refactor(api): Remove default tags from go structs and set the values explicitly

Also add stream_options, so we can set ollama default token usage to true, it's set to false by default and not shown on the final SSE message - by setting it explicitly to true we get token usages from all providers.

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* refactor(api): Change model slices to use pointers for improved memory efficiency and compatibility

Cohere apparently haven't implemented stream_options so when we send the request with stream_options attributes in the payload we get 422 Unprocessable entity status. Kind of weird that they call it "Compatible" API because it's clearly not. Anyways that would be a quick patch for this special case.

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* refactor(api): Cloudflare like Cohere did a partial job in implementing compatibility for OpenAI - fixing it

Also checking for nil Usage since it's a pointer now and will be omitted on some cases.

Signed-off-by: Eden Reich <eden.reich@gmail.com>

* refactor(api): Improve telemetry middleware logging and enforce usage tracking for streaming completions

For Usage metrics I just need the last 2 messages, this improve the speed of parsing the usage.
