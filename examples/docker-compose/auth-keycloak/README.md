# Authentication Example

This example protects the Inference Gateway with OIDC authentication using
[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) as the identity provider, entirely via
Docker Compose.

When `AUTH_ENABLED=true`, every request (except `/health`) must carry a valid
`Authorization: Bearer <access token>` header. The gateway discovers the issuer
at startup, verifies each token's signature, issuer, expiry and audience against
it, and answers rejected requests with `401` plus a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`
challenge ([RFC 6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750#section-3)).

## Overview

The stack runs three services:

- **keycloak** - identity provider, pre-seeded with a realm and a confidential
  client with a service account via an imported realm file.
- **keycloak-ready** - a short-lived helper that blocks the gateway from starting
  until Keycloak's discovery endpoint is live. The gateway performs OIDC
  discovery at boot and exits if the issuer is unreachable, so this ordering
  matters.
- **inference-gateway** - the gateway, started with authentication enabled and
  pointed at the Keycloak realm.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file from the template (provider keys are optional for the
   auth demo) and make the token helper executable:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   chmod +x get-token.sh
   ```

2. Start the stack:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   The gateway waits for Keycloak to finish importing the realm before it
   starts. Follow its logs with:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f inference-gateway
   ```

## Testing authentication

1. An unauthenticated request is rejected with `401 Unauthorized` and a
   `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="inference-gateway"` header:

   ```bash
   curl -i http://localhost:8080/v1/models
   ```

2. Fetch an access token from Keycloak and retry with it:

   ```bash
   TOKEN="$(./get-token.sh)"

   curl -i http://localhost:8080/v1/models \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
   ```

   This request returns `200 OK`.

`./get-token.sh` uses the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant, the flow an
application or agent uses to call an API on its own behalf. To do it by hand:

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  http://localhost:8081/realms/inference-gateway-realm/protocol/openid-connect/token \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d client_id=inference-gateway-client \
  -d client_secret=very-secret
```

The token's `sub` and `preferred_username`
(`service-account-inference-gateway-client`) are what identity-based guardrails
see in `input.identity`.

## MCP clients discover Keycloak on their own

The compose file exposes the gateway as an MCP server (`MCP_ENABLED=true`,
`MCP_EXPOSE=true`), so an MCP client needs no pre-issued token to find the IdP,
as MCP `2026-07-28` requires. The `401` from `/mcp` points at the OAuth 2.0
Protected Resource Metadata
([RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728)) document, which
names this realm:

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp
# WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="inference-gateway", resource_metadata="http://localhost:8080/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp"

curl http://localhost:8080/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp
# {"resource":"http://localhost:8080/mcp",
#  "authorization_servers":["http://keycloak:8080/realms/inference-gateway-realm"],
#  "bearer_methods_supported":["header"]}
```

The document itself takes no token - like `/health`, it is fetched precisely
because the client has none yet. The client then reads Keycloak's own
`/.well-known/openid-configuration` under that issuer and runs its grant, which
is what `get-token.sh` does by hand above.

`resource` defaults to the request scheme (honouring `X-Forwarded-Proto`) and
`Host`; behind an ingress that rewrites either, set `MCP_RESOURCE_URL` to the
canonical public `/mcp` URL. If the IdP is configured to stamp that resource
into `aud` ([RFC 8707](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8707)), list the
same value in `AUTH_OIDC_AUDIENCE`.

## Running a real chat completion

Every endpoint except `/health` requires a token once auth is enabled. To
exercise a real completion, add a provider key to `.env` (for example
`OPENAI_API_KEY=...`), recreate the gateway with `docker compose up -d`, then:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]}'
```

## Troubleshooting

The shape of an error tells you which layer rejected the request:

- **`401` with `{"error":"unauthorized"}`** - the gateway rejected _your_ bearer
  token. The `WWW-Authenticate` header says why: no `error` parameter means no
  bearer token was sent, `error="invalid_token"` means it was sent but is
  expired, malformed, signed by another issuer, or carries the wrong audience.
  Re-fetch it with `TOKEN="$(./get-token.sh)"` and resend. `get-token.sh` prints
  a clear error and exits non-zero if Keycloak itself rejects the request, so an
  empty `$TOKEN` does not slip through silently.
- **`400` with `Provider requires an API key`** - no key is configured in `.env`
  for the provider you addressed (for example `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` for
  `deepseek/...`).
- **A _nested_ error such as `{"error":"{\"error\":\"...\"}"}`** - the gateway
  authenticated you and forwarded the request upstream, but the _provider_
  rejected it (usually an invalid API key, or a model the provider does not
  serve). The inner JSON is the provider's own error; fix the key or model.

## How it works

- Authentication is enabled through the gateway service's `environment` block in
  `docker-compose.yml` (`AUTH_ENABLED`, `AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER`, `AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`),
  so the generated `.env.example` stays untouched. The gateway only verifies
  tokens against the issuer's public keys, so it never needs the client secret.
- Keycloak starts with `--import-realm` and the realm definition in
  `keycloak/realm-export.json`. That realm adds an **audience mapper** so access
  tokens include `inference-gateway-client` in their `aud` claim, which the
  gateway checks against `AUTH_OIDC_AUDIENCE` (defaulting to
  `AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`). The mapper is limited to access tokens, so an ID token
  is not accepted as an API credential.
- `KC_HOSTNAME` pins Keycloak's public URL to `http://keycloak:8080`, so tokens
  always carry the same issuer the gateway discovered on the compose network,
  even when you request them from the host on port `8081`.

## Other identity providers

Nothing in the gateway is Keycloak-specific: any provider that serves an OpenID
Connect discovery document works. Signature, issuer and expiry checks come from
that document. The only per-provider detail is what its access tokens carry in
`aud`, which must match one of the `AUTH_OIDC_AUDIENCE` values:

| Provider                                         | `AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER`                                          | `AUTH_OIDC_AUDIENCE`                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keycloak                                         | `https://<host>/realms/<realm>`                             | the client ID, added to access tokens by an audience mapper (this example)                            |
| [Microsoft Entra ID](../auth-entra/README.md)    | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0`        | the API registration's client ID (v2 tokens) or `api://<app-id>` (v1 tokens)                          |
| [Google service accounts](../auth-gcp/README.md) | `https://accounts.google.com`                               | any URL you choose; the issuer is shared by every Google account, so pair it with a guardrails policy |
| [Amazon Cognito](../auth-cognito/README.md)      | `https://cognito-idp.<region>.amazonaws.com/<user-pool-id>` | the app client ID; machine tokens carry no `aud`, so the gateway checks `client_id` instead           |
| Auth0                                            | `https://<tenant>.auth0.com/` (trailing slash)              | the API identifier; a token requested without an `audience` is opaque and cannot be verified          |
| Okta                                             | `https://<org>.okta.com/oauth2/<authorization-server-id>`   | the custom authorization server's audience (the org server issues opaque tokens)                      |

Tokens with no `aud` claim at all are accepted when their `client_id` claim
matches one of the configured values, which is how Cognito machine tokens work.

## Keycloak admin console

The realm and confidential client are created automatically from
`keycloak/realm-export.json`, so the admin console is not required for this
example. Keycloak's admin endpoints are reachable on
[http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) with `admin` / `admin`, though
browser login flows assume the internal `keycloak` hostname and are intended for
the in-network gateway rather than host browsers.

## Cleanup

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
